# PyLEMS 

###A [LEMS](http://neuroml.org/lems/)/[NeuroML2](http://neuroml.org/neuroml2.php) simulator written in Python


## Installation
Check the code out of github.

    git clone git@github.com:LEMS/pylems.git

This will create a directory named pylems. Add this directory to your PATH and PYTHONPATH variables.

## Usage

    pylems [\<options\>] \<LEMS file\>

### Options
- -I/-include \<path\> - Adds a directory to the model file include search path
- -XI/-xsl-include \<path\> - Adds a directory to the XSL preprocessor include path

## Tasks
- Implement flattening
- Decouple events from runnables
- Perform dimension-checking on expressions.
- Simple LEMS API for creating, reading and writing LEMS model files (DONE)
- Implement LEMS API over lems.model.* (NeuroML API?)
  - Interface with libNeuroML and Pyramidal to export Neuron MOD files
  - Export C files (Interface? Steve Marshâ€™s project?)
- Assertions.
- XPath implementation.
- Implement Runnables from Component types instead of expanded typeless Components (Required for efficient C/C++ code generation, but conflicts with flattening)
